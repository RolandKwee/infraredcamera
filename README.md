# infraredcamera

Raspberry Pi with Melexis MLX90640 infrared sensor plus visible light camera using C++ and Python

## Project Status

The project is in a working state: taking infrared pictures on the Raspberry Pi works by storing to a usb memory stick,
and viewing those captures on the pc works too.

## Repo Status

This github repository is under construction.
I just started bringing all files to this repo. 
This will take some steps, bear with me.
